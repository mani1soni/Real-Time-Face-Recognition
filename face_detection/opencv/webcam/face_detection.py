# To capture a video, you need to create a VideoCapture object.
# Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video 
# file. Device index is just the number to specify which camera. 
# Normally one camera will be connected (as in my case). So I simply 
# pass 0 (or -1). You can select the second camera by passing 1 and 
# so on. After that, you can capture frame-by-frame. 
# But at the end, donâ€™t forget to release the capture.

# This line sets the video source to the default webcam, which OpenCV can easily capture.

# A video file can also be passed here, but you need to have 
# ffmpeg installed for that since OpenCV itself cannot decode
# compressed video. Ffmpeg acts as the front end for OpenCV, 
# and, ideally, it should be compiled directly into OpenCV. 
# This is not easy to do, especially on Windows.
