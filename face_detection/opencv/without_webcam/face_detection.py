# IMPORTANT PART

# Detect faces in the image
# The detectMultiScale function is a general function that detects objects. Since we are calling it on the face cascade, thatâ€™s what it detects.
# scale factor compensates for different different sizes of face in the image.
# The detection algorithm takes up a small window os size == minSize and hovers it throughout the image. But generally minSize is smaller than the size of the face, hence we define a parameter called minNeighbors which says how many objects are detected near the current one before it declares the face found. 

faces = faceCascade.detectMultiScale(
    gray,
    scaleFactor=1.1,
    minNeighbors=5,
    minSize=(30, 30)
)

# The function returns a list of rectangles in which it believes it found a face.
print("Found {0} faces!".format(len(faces)))

# Next, we will loop over where it thinks it found something and
# draw a rectangle around the faces
for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
    cv2.rectangle(image_rgb, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

cv2.imshow("Faces Detected", image)
